# Introduction

[cite_start]Kitledger is a code-first, headless software engine for building transactional systems that rely on double-entry accounting[cite: 10].

[cite_start]It allows developers to craft robust systems for a wide range of business scenarios by providing foundational building blocks rather than a monolithic suite[cite: 11, 15].

## Why Kitledger?

Most business software forces painful tradeoffs:

1.  [cite_start]**Monolithic Complexity:** Trying to solve every scenario leads to bloated platforms[cite: 16].
2.  [cite_start]**Rigid Constraints:** Companies are forced to adapt their processes to the software[cite: 20].
3.  [cite_start]**The "SaaS Trap":** Integration gaps are filled with spreadsheets and fragile connections[cite: 21].

[cite_start]Kitledger separates the fundamental accounting principles (Immutable Ledger, ACID Guarantees, Audit Trails) from your specific business logic [cite: 46-53].
