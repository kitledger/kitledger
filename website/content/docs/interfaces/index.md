# Interfaces

Kitledger is headless, meaning it can power any frontend. However, it ships with tools to speed up development.

## The Admin UI
[cite_start]The `@kitledger/admin` package provides an auto-generated management interface that evolves in real-time with your code definitions[cite: 101, 102].

## Forms
[cite_start]Use `defineTransactionForm` to create type-safe input mechanisms for your transaction models, complete with validation and localization support[cite: 113].
